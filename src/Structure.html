		<h1>MARGARET MUNNERLYN MITCHELL</h1>
		<hr>
		<p> Margaret Munnerlyn Mitchell (November 8, 1900 - August 16, 1949)<sub>[2]</sub> was an American <b>novelist</b> and <b>journalist</b>. Mitchell wrote only one novel, published during her lifetime, the <u>American Civil War-era</u> novel <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, for which she won the National Book Award for Fiction for Most Distinguished Novel of 1936<sub>[3]</sub> and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in <del>1936</del><ins> 1937</ins>. Long after her death, a collection of Mitchell's girlhood writings and a novella she wrote as a teenager, titled <i>Lost Laysen</i>, were published. A collection of newspaper articles written by Mitchell for <b>The Atlanta Journal</b> was republished in book form. <br/>Mitchell was struck and killed by a speeding drunk driver in 1949.</p>
		<h2> GONE WITH THE WIND</h2>
		<hr/>
		<p>In May 1926, after Mitchell had left her job at the <i>Atlanta Journal</i> and was recovering at home from her ankle injury, she wrote a society column for the <i>Sunday Magazine</i>, <q>Elizabeth Bennet's Gossip</q>, which she continued to write until August<sup>[74]:xv</sup>.Meanwhile, her husband was growing weary of lugging armloads of books home from the library to keep his wife's mind occupied while she hobbled around the house; he emphatically suggested that she write her own book instead:<blockquote>For God's sake, Peggy, can't you write a book instead of reading thousands of them?</blockquote>In April 1935, <em>Harold Latham</em> of Macmillan, an editor looking for new fiction, read her manuscript and saw that it could be a best-seller. After Latham agreed to publish the book, Mitchell worked for another six months checking the historical references and rewriting the opening chapter several times.[102] Mitchell and John Marsh edited the final version of the novel.[103]
